    <h1 class="page-title">My Web Design Work</h1>
    <p class="body-text">As a web developer, I mainly like to work with front-end but I also occasionally work with back-end. I aim to make websites that look nice and are easy for users to navigate, which is something that I feel is often not taken into account during the development process. I mainly work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for development. I have also recently been working on mastering Angular. This website was actually built using Angular. I am also currently learning how to use MongoDB, Node, and Express. Click my projects below to check them out. </p>
